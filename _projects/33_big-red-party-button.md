excerpt: <p>To add more posh appeal to the Walker Art Center's After Hours preview parties, I created this photobooth-on-steriods. It takes a photo of visitors using a high-fashion ring flash, and automatically displays the photo via several projectors. Photos can also be uploaded to Flickr, Facebook, or other sources in real time.</p>
