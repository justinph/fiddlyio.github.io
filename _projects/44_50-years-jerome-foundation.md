excerpt: <p>To show the breadth of impact for the 50th anniversary of this arts foundation, I created a series of charts that show the growth of grant programs and financial stability. The scrolling navigation lets many graphs exist on a single page. It was built using d3.js, require.js, and Google fusion tables.</p>
