excerpt: <p>Prior to the election, I redesigned and modernized tools such as <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/projects/ongoing/select_a_candidate/">Select A Candidate</a> and <a href="http://apps.mprnews.org/polling_place/">Polling Place Finder</a>. I also prepared our results pages for election night, which were responsive, built using google maps & fusion tables, and integrated results from the Associated Press and MN Secretary of State.</p>
