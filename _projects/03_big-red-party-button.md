excerpt: <p>Minnesota Public Radio News is one of the nation’s most successful public radio franchises. It needed a substantial overhaul of it’s website to match it’s large digital-only reporting efforts while still keeping audio listening a first-class experience.</p> <p>This is a responsive website in the truest sense of the word; it’s designed to be fast and to look good and work well on all screen sizes.</p>
