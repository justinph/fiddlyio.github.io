excerpt: "<p>The project was divided into three phases: Design, voting, and application. In the design phase, we solicited visitors to design signs for yards, as a communal political gallery. Phase two asked users to vote for the 50 best signs. Phase 3 installed and mapped the signs across the Twin Cities.</p>"
