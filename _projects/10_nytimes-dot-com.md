## Accessibility

Accessibility (a11y) has been a passion project of mine at the NYT. By organizing our internal accessibility community of practice, I try to support other staff who are interested in improving accessibility of their work. We have bi-weekly office hours and occasional talks on accesibility subjects.

When teams or projects ask, I am happy to conduct ad-hoc accessibility reviews and have even been known to submit pull requests with a11y improvements to codebases that I don't typically work in.

[ html sitemap screenshot here ]

As part of my team's work on SEO, we re-wrote the our XML sitemap to work seamlessly and accurately with our distributed publishing system. However, we didn't initally update our HTML sitemap. With this simple but useful project, we did just that.

The HTML sitemap is a simple list of every date the Times has been published, listing and linking to every piece of content ever published. Just simple, linked lists, use for humans and search engine robots.
