## [Accused priests: Who they are, where they’ve served, what’s alleged](http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/catholic-church/priest-list/)

A large team of journalists and editors worked for over a year investigating the pattern of sexual abuse by priests and the Catholic Church's systemic cover-up of the abuse. Journalist [Meg Martin](https://twitter.com/meg_e_martin) compiled a detailed list of information about priests accused and convited of abuse. We [published this information online and organized into a searchable database](http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/catholic-church/priest-list/) that showed our audience when and where the priests served.  

The simple interface for this project was built using portions of twitter bootstrap. D3.js allowed the journalists and producers to simply export CSV files any time data was added or updated.

This project, specifically the database of priests, won the University of Florida's award in Investigative Data Journalism for a Small/Medium organization from the Online News Association.
