When a linked item appears in a news feed that links to a page that contains an <object> tag that has a data-URI containing svg, the in-app browser briefly opens and then closes, preventing the user from seeing the linked page. It does not appear to affect raster images that are encoded into a data-URI. 

I've made a test page that demonstrates this. Post to your wall/news feed and then view it in the Facebook android app:

This occurs in v24.0.0.30.15 of the Android app, tested on android 5.x. It does not appear to affect the Facebook iOS app, nor does it affect other browsers on Android. 

My gut tells me this might have something to do with a cross domain or content security policy issue.
